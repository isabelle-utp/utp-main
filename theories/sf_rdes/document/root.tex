\title{Stateful-Failure Reactive Designs in Isabelle/UTP}

\author{Simon Foster \and James Baxter \and Ana Cavalcanti \and Jim Woodcock}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Stateful-Failure Reactive Designs specialise reactive design contracts with failures traces,
  as present in languages like CSP and Circus. A failure trace consists of a sequence of events
  and a refusal set. It intuitively represents a quiescent observation, where certain events have
  previously occurred, and others are currently being accepted. Following the UTP book, we add 
  an observational variable to represent refusal sets, and healthiness conditions that ensure 
  their well-formedness. Using these, we also specialise our theory of reactive relations with 
  operators to characterise both completed and quiescent interactions, and an accompanying
  equational theory. We use these to define the core operators --- including assignment, event occurence, 
  and external choice --- and specialise our proof strategy to support these. We also demonstrate 
  a link with the CSP failures-divergences semantic model.

\section{Introduction}

This document contains a mechanisation in Isabelle/UTP~\cite{Foster16a} of an specialisation of
stateful reactive designs with refusal information, as present in languages like 
Circus~\cite{Oliveira2005-PHD}.
