(* Title:      Irrational_Series_Erdos_Straus.thy
   Author:     Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki and Wenda Li, University of Cambridge, UK.

We formalise certain irrationality criteria for infinite series by P. Erdos and E.G. Straus.
In particular, we formalise Theorem 2.1, Corollary 2.10 and Theorem 3.1 in [1]. The latter is an 
application of Theorem 2.1 involving the prime numbers.
