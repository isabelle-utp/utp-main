\title{From Abstract to Concrete G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems---Part I}
\author{Andrei Popescu \and Dmitriy Traytel}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} We validate an abstract formulation of G\"odel's First and Second Incompleteness Theorems
from a \href{https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_Incompleteness.html}{separate AFP entry} by instantiating
them to the case of \emph{finite sound extensions of the Hereditarily Finite (HF) Set theory}, i.e., FOL
theories extending the HF Set theory with a finite set of axioms that are sound in the standard model. The
concrete results had been previously formalised in an
\href{https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html}{AFP entry by Larry Paulson}; our instantiation
reuses the infrastructure developed in that entry.
