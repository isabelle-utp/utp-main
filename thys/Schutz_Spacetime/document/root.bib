  abstract = {The primary aim of this monograph is to clarify the undefined primitive concepts and the axioms which form the basis of Einstein's theory of special relativity. Minkowski space-time is developed from a set of independent axioms, stated in terms of a single relation of betweenness. It is shown that all models are isomorphic to the usual coordinate model, and the axioms are consistent relative to the reals.},
