  description
    \<open>SpecCheck is a specification-based testing environment for ML programs. It is based on QCheck
    (\<^url>\<open>https://github.com/league/qcheck/\<close>) by Christopher League (\<^url>\<open>https://contrapunctus.net/\<close>).
    It got adapted and extended to fit into the Isabelle/ML framework and resemble the very
    successful QuickCheck (\<^url>\<open>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck\<close>) more closely.\<close>
