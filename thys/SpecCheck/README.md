# SpecCheck

SpecCheck is a [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck)-like testing framework for Isabelle/ML.
You can use it to write specifications for ML functions.
SpecCheck then checks whether your specification holds by testing your function against a given number of generated inputs.
It helps you to identify bugs by printing counterexamples on failure and provides you timing information.

SpecCheck is customisable and allows you to specify your own input generators,
test output formats, as well as pretty printers and shrinking functions for counterexamples
among other things.

## Quick Usage
1. Import `SpecCheck.SpecCheck` into your environment.
2. Write specifications using the ML invocation: `check show gen name prop ctxt seed` where
  * `show` converts values into `Pretty.T` types to show the failing inputs. See `show/`.
  * `gen` is the value generator used for the test. See `generators/`.
  * `name` is the name of the test case
  * `prop` is the property to be tested. See `property.ML`
  * `seed` is the initial seed for the generator.

You can also choose to omit the show method for rapid testing or add a shrinking method Ã  la
QuickCheck to get better counterexamples. See `speccheck.ML`.

An experimental alternative allows you to specify tests using strings:
1. Import `SpecCheck_Dynamic.Dynamic` into your environment.
2. `check_property "ALL x. P x"` where `P x` is some ML code evaluating to a boolean

Examples can be found in `examples/`.

## Notes

SpecCheck is based on [QCheck](https://github.com/league/qcheck), a testing framework for Standard ML by
[Christopher League](https://contrapunctus.net/league/).
As Isabelle/ML provides a rich and uniform ML platform, some features where removed or adapted, in particular:

1. Isabelle/ML provides common data structures, which we can use in the
tool's implementation for storing data and printing output.

2. Implementations in Isabelle/ML checked with this tool commonly use Isabelle/ML's `int` type
(which corresponds ML's `IntInf.int`), but do not use other integer types in ML such as ML's `Int.int`,
`Word.word`, and others.

3. As Isabelle makes heavy use of parallelism, we avoid reference types.

## Next Steps

* Implement more shrinking methods for commonly used types
* Implement sizing methods (cf. QuickCheck's `sized`)
