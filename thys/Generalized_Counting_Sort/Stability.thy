In this section, it is formally proven that GCsort is \emph{stable}, viz. that the sublist of the
output of function @{const gcsort} built by picking out the objects having a given key matches the
sublist of the input objects' list built in the same way.

Here below, steps 5, 6, and 7 of the proof method are accomplished. Particularly, @{text stab_inv}
is the predicate that will be shown to be invariant over inductive set @{const gcsort_set}.

fun stab_inv :: "('b \<Rightarrow> 'a list) \<Rightarrow> ('a \<Rightarrow> 'b) \<Rightarrow> nat \<times> nat list \<times> 'a list \<Rightarrow>
  bool" where
"stab_inv f key (u, ns, xs) = (\<forall>k. [x\<leftarrow>xs. key x = k] = f k)"

lemma gcsort_stab_input:
 "stab_inv (\<lambda>k. [x\<leftarrow>xs. key x = k]) key (0, [length xs], xs)"
by simp

lemma gcsort_stab_intro:
 "stab_inv f key t \<Longrightarrow> [x\<leftarrow>gcsort_out t. key x = k] = f k"
by (cases t, simp add: gcsort_out_def)

In what follows, step 9 of the proof method is accomplished.

First, lemma @{text fill_offs_enum_stable} proves that function @{const fill}, if its input offsets'
list is computed via the composition of functions @{const offs} and @{const enum}, does not modify
the sublist of its input objects' list formed by the objects having a given key. Moreover, lemmas
@{text mini_stable} and @{text maxi_stable} prove that the extraction of the leftmost minimum and
the rightmost maximum from an objects' list through functions @{const mini} and @{const maxi} is
endowed with the same property.

These lemmas are then used to prove lemma @{text gcsort_stab_inv}, which states that the sublist of
the objects having a given key within the objects' list is still the same after any recursive round.

The only remaining task is to address step 10 of the proof method, which is done by proving theorem
@{text gcsort_stable}. It holds under the conditions that the objects' number is not larger than the
counters' upper bound and function @{text index} satisfies both predicates @{const index_less} and
@{const index_same}, and states that function @{const gcsort} leaves unchanged the sublist of the
objects having a given key within the input objects' list.
