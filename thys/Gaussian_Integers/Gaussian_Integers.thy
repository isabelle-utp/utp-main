  Gaussian integers are the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ which is formed either by formally adjoining
  an element $i$ with $i^2 = -1$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ or by taking all the complex numbers with
  integer real and imaginary part.

  We define them simply by giving an appropriate ring structure to $\mathbb{Z}^2$, with the first
  component representing the real part and the second component the imaginary part:

  We can now define division on Gaussian integers simply by performing the division in the
  complex numbers and rounding the result. This also gives us a remainder operation defined
  accordingly for which the norm of the remainder is always smaller than the norm of the divisor.

  We can also define a normalisation operation that returns a canonical representative for each
  association class. Since the four units of the Gaussian integers are \<open>\<plusminus>1\<close> and \<open>\<plusminus>\<i>\<close>, each
  association class (other than \<open>0\<close>) has four representatives, one in each quadrant. We simply
  define the on in the upper-right quadrant (i.e.\ the one with non-negative imaginary part
  and positive real part) as the canonical one.

  Thus, the Gaussian integers form a Euclidean ring. This gives us many things, most importantly
  the existence of GCDs and LCMs and unique factorisation.

  Next, we analyse what the prime elements of the Gaussian integers are. First, note that
  according to the conventions of Isabelle's computational algebra library, a prime element
  is called a prime iff it is also normalised, i.e.\ in our case it lies in the upper right
  quadrant.

  As a first fact, we can show that a Gaussian integer whose norm is \<open>\<int>\<close>-prime must be
  $\mathbb{Z}[i]$-prime:
