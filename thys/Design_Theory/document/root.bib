@book{stinsonCombinatorialDesignsConstructions2004,
	abstract = {Created to teach students many of the most important techniques used for constructing combinatorial designs, this is an ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in combinatorial design theory. The text features clear explanations of basic designs, such as Steiner and Kirkman triple systems, mutual orthogonal Latin squares, finite projective and affine planes, and Steiner quadruple systems. In these settings, the student will master various construction techniques, both classic and modern, and will be well-prepared to construct a vast array of combinatorial designs. Design theory offers a progressive approach to the subject, with carefully ordered results. It begins with simple constructions that gradually increase in complexity. Each design has a construction that contains new ideas or that reinforces and builds upon similar ideas previously introduced. A new text/reference covering all apsects of modern combinatorial design theory. Graduates and professionals in computer science, applied mathematics, combinatorics, and applied statistics will find the book an essential resource.},

  abstract = {A multiset is a set with repeated elements. There are four distinct partition numbers to consider, unlike the classical set partition case which involves only Stirling numbers of the second kind. Using inclusion-exclusion, we obtain generating functions when each element appears exactly r = 1, 2 or 3 times. The case r = 1 is classical and r = 2 was studied by Comtet and Bar\'oti using other methods. Our approach also leads to asymptotic formulae for the total number of partitions of multisets in which the repetition of elements is bounded. Another approach to multiset enumeration, using de Brujin's theorem for group reduced distributions, is described.},
