  Each statement in the formal text is annotated with the location of the originating statement
  in Jacobson's text @{cite Jacobson1985}.  Each fact that Jacobson states explicitly is marked
  as @{command theorem} unless it is translated to a @{command sublocale} declaration.
  Literal quotations from Jacobson's text are reproduced in double quotes.

  Auxiliary results needed for the formalisation that cannot be found in Jacobson's text are marked
  as @{command lemma} or are @{command interpretation}s.  Such results are annotated with the
  location of a related statement.  For example, the introduction rule of a constant is annotated
  with the location of the definition of the corresponding operation.
