    This theory develops an ``object-free'' definition of category loosely following
    \cite{AHS}, Sec. 3.52-3.53.
    We define the notion ``category'' in terms of axioms that concern a single
    partial binary operation on a type, some of whose elements are to be regarded
    as the ``arrows'' of the category.

    The nonstandard definition of category has some advantages and disadvantages.
    An advantage is that only one piece of data (the composition operation) is required
    to specify a category, so the use of records is not required to bundle up several
    separate objects.  A related advantage is the fact that functors and natural
    transformations can be defined simply to be functions that satisfy certain axioms,
    rather than more complex composite objects.
    One disadvantage is that the notions of ``object'' and ``identity arrow'' are
    conflated, though this is easy to get used to.  Perhaps a more significant disadvantage
    is that each arrow of a category must carry along the information about its domain
    and codomain. This implies, for example, that the arrows of a category of sets and
    functions cannot be directly identified with functions, but rather only with functions that
    have been equipped with their domain and codomain sets.

    To represent the partiality of the composition operation of a category, we assume that the
    composition for a category has a unique zero element, which we call \<open>null\<close>,
    and we consider arrows to be ``composable'' if and only if their composite is non-null.
    Functors and natural transformations are required to map arrows to arrows and be
    ``extensional'' in the sense that they map non-arrows to null.  This is so that
    equality of functors and natural transformations coincides with their extensional equality
    as functions in HOL.
    The fact that we co-opt an element of the arrow type to serve as \<open>null\<close> means that
    it is not possible to define a category whose arrows exhaust the elements of a given type.
    This presents a disadvantage in some situations.  For example, we cannot construct a
    discrete category whose arrows are directly identified with the set of \emph{all}
    elements of a given type @{typ 'a}; instead, we must pass to a larger type
    (such as @{typ "'a option"}) so that there is an element available for use as \<open>null\<close>.
    The presence of \<open>null\<close>, however, is crucial to our being able to define a
    system of introduction and elimination rules that can be applied automatically to establish
    that a given expression denotes an arrow.  Without \<open>null\<close>, we would be able to
    define an introduction rule to infer, say, that the composition of composable arrows
    is composable, but not an elimination rule to infer that arrows are composable from
    the fact that their composite is an arrow.  Having the ability to do both is critical
    to the usability of the theory.

  section "Partial Magmas"

  text \<open>
    A \emph{partial magma} is a partial binary operation \<open>C\<close> defined on the set
    of elements at a type @{typ 'a}.  As discussed above,
    we assume the existence of a unique element \<open>null\<close> of type @{typ 'a}
    that is a zero for \<open>C\<close>, and we use \<open>null\<close> to represent ``undefined''.
    We think of the operation \<open>C\<close> as an operation of ``composition'', and
    we regard elements \<open>f\<close> and \<open>g\<close> of type @{typ 'a} as \emph{composable}
    if \<open>C g f \<noteq> null\<close>.

      A \emph{domain} of an element \<open>f\<close> is an identity \<open>a\<close> for which composition of
      \<open>f\<close> with \<open>a\<close> on the right is defined.
      The notion \emph{codomain} is defined similarly, using composition on the left.
      Note that, although these definitions are completely dual, the choice of terminology
      implies that we will think of composition as being written in traditional order,
      as opposed to diagram order.  It is pretty much essential to do it this way, to maintain
      compatibility with the notation for function application once we start working with
      functors and natural transformations.

      Using the notions of domain and codomain, we can define \emph{homs}.
      The predicate @{term "in_hom f a b"} expresses ``@{term f} is an arrow from @{term a}
      to @{term b},'' and the term @{term "hom a b"} denotes the set of all such arrows.
      It is convenient to have both of these, though passing back and forth sometimes involves
      extra work.  We choose @{term "in_hom"} as the more fundamental notion.

  section "Categories"

  text\<open>
    A \emph{category} is defined to be a partial magma whose composition satisfies an
    extensionality condition, an associativity condition, and the requirement that every
    arrow have both a domain and a codomain.
    The associativity condition involves four ``matching conditions''
    (\<open>match_1\<close>, \<open>match_2\<close>, \<open>match_3\<close>, and \<open>match_4\<close>)
    which constrain the domain of definition of the composition, and a fifth condition
    (\<open>comp_assoc'\<close>) which states that the results of the two ways of composing
    three elements are equal.  In the presence of the \<open>comp_assoc'\<close> axiom
    \<open>match_4\<close> can be derived from \<open>match_3\<close> and vice versa.

      Associativity of composition holds unconditionally.  This was not the case in
      previous, weaker versions of this theory, and I did not notice this for some
      time after updating to the current axioms.  It is obviously an advantage that
      no additional hypotheses have to be verified in order to apply associativity,
      but a disadvantage is that this fact is now ``too readily applicable,''
      so that if it is made a default simplification it tends to get in the way of
      applying other simplifications that we would also like to be able to apply automatically.
      So, it now seems best not to make this fact a default simplification, but rather
      to invoke it explicitly where it is required.

      To obtain the ``only if'' direction in the next two results and in similar results later
      for composition and the application of functors and natural transformations,
      is the reason for assuming the existence of @{term null} as a special element of the
      arrow type, as opposed to, say, using option types to represent partiality.
      The presence of @{term null} allows us not only to make the ``upward'' inference that
      the domain of an arrow is again an arrow, but also to make the ``downward'' inference
      that if @{term "dom f"} is an arrow then so is @{term f}.  Similarly, we will be able
      to infer not only that if @{term f} and @{term g} are composable arrows then
      @{term "C g f"} is an arrow, but also that if @{term "C g f"} is an arrow then
      \<open>f\<close> and \<open>g\<close> are composable arrows.  These inferences allow most necessary
      facts about what terms denote arrows to be deduced automatically from minimal
      assumptions.  Typically all that is required is to assume or establish that certain
      terms denote arrows in particular homs at the point where those terms are first
      introduced, and then similar facts about related terms can be derived automatically.
      Without this feature, nearly every proof would involve many tedious additional steps
      to establish that each of the terms appearing in the proof (including all its subterms)
      in fact denote arrows.

      In some contexts, this rule causes the simplifier to loop, but it is too useful
      not to have as a default simplification.  In cases where it is a problem, usually
      a method like \emph{blast} or \emph{force} will succeed if this rule is cited
      explicitly.

      The next two results are sometimes useful for performing manipulations at the
      head of a chain of composed arrows.  I have adopted the convention that such
      chains are canonically represented in right-associated form.  This makes it
      easy to perform manipulations at the ``tail'' of a chain, but more difficult
      to perform them at the ``head''.  These results take care of the rote manipulations
      using associativity that are needed to either permute or combine arrows at the
      head of a chain.

      Here we define some common configurations of arrows.
      These are defined as abbreviations, because we want all ``diagrammatic'' assumptions
      in a theorem to reduce readily to a conjunction of assertions of the basic forms
      @{term "arr f"}, @{term "dom f = X"}, @{term "cod f = Y"}, and @{term "in_hom f a b"}.
