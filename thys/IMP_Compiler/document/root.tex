\title{A Shorter Compiler Correctness Proof\\for Language IMP}
\author{Pasquale Noce\\Software Engineer at HID Global, Italy\\pasquale dot noce dot lavoro at gmail dot com\\pasquale dot noce at hidglobal dot com}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a compiler correctness proof for the didactic imperative programming language
IMP, introduced in Nipkow and Klein's book on formal programming language semantics (version of
March 2021), whose size is just two thirds of the book's proof in the number of formal text lines.
As such, it promises to constitute a further enhanced reference for the formal verification of
compilers meant for larger, real-world programming languages.

The presented proof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed approach can be
applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a confirmation, this paper extends IMP with an
additional non-deterministic choice command, and proves compiler correctness, viz. the simulation of
compiled code execution by source code, for such extended language.
