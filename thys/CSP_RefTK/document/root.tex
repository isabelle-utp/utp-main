\title{The HOL-CSP Refinement Toolkit}
\author{ Safouan Taha \and Burkhart Wolff \and Lina Ye }
\maketitle
\chapter*{Abstract}

   Recently, a modern version of Roscoes and Brookes \cite{brookes-roscoe85} 
   Failure-Divergence Semantics for CSP has been formalized in Isabelle \cite{HOL-CSP-AFP}. 
   
   We use  this formal development called HOL-CSP2.0 to analyse a family of refinement 
   notions, comprising classic and new ones. 
   This analysis enables to derive a number of properties that allow to deepen the 
   understanding of these notions, in particular with respect to specification 
   decomposition principles for the case of infinite sets of events. The established 
   relations between the refinement relations help to clarify some obscure points in the 
   CSP literature, but also provide a weapon for shorter refinement proofs. Furthermore, 
   we provide a framework for state-normalisation allowing to formally reason on 
   parameterised process architectures.
   
   As a result, we have a modern environment for formal proofs of concurrent systems that 
   allow for the combination of general infinite processes with locally finite ones in a 
   logically safe way.  We demonstrate these verification-techniques for classical, 
   generalised examples: The CopyBuffer for arbitrary data and the Dijkstra's Dining 
   Philosopher Problem of arbitrary size.
