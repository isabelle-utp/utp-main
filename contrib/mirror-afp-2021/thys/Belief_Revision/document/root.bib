abstract = "Suppose one is given a description of a system, together with an observation of the system's behaviour which conflicts with the way the system is meant to behave. The diagnostic problem is to determine those components of the system which, when assumed to be functioning abnormally, will explain the discrepancy between the observed and correct system behaviour. We propose a general theory for this problem. The theory requires only that the system be described in a suitable logic. Moreover, there are many such suitable logics, e.g. first-order, temporal, dynamic, etc. As a result, the theory accommodates diagnostic reasoning in a wide variety of practical settings, including digital and analogue circuits, medicine, and database updates. The theory leads to an algorithm for computing all diagnoses, and to various results concerning principles of measurement for discriminating among competing diagnoses. Finally, the theory reveals close connections between diagnostic reasoning and nonmonotonic reasoning."

abstract = {Traditionally, studies examining decision-making heuristics and biases (H&B) have focused on aggregate effects using between-subjects designs in order to demonstrate violations of rationality. Although H&B are often studied in isolation from others, emerging research has suggested that stable and reliable individual differences in rational thought exist, and similarity in performance across tasks are related, which may suggest an underlying phenotypic structure of decision-making skills. Though numerous theoretical and empirical classifications have been offered, results have been mixed. The current study aimed to clarify this research question. Participants (N = 289) completed a battery of 17 H&B tasks, assessed with a within-subjects design, that we selected based on a review of prior empirical and theoretical taxonomies. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses yielded a solution that suggested that these biases conform to a model composed of three dimensions: Mindware gaps, Valuation biases (i.e., Positive Illusions and Negativity effect), and Anchoring and Adjustment. We discuss these findings in relation to proposed taxonomies and existing studies on individual differences in decision-making.}

This hypothesis was tested in a factor-analytic study in which 111 subjects completed seven measures of heuristic use and three measures of conditional reasoning. A principal components analysis of the measures revealed two main factors, corresponding to an availability dimension and a representativeness dimension. There was no evidence for the hypothesis that the disposition to infer "Y is X" given "X is Y" underlies either dimension, although one measure of conditional reasoning, Wason's selection task, was related to both. This result is discussed in terms of Evans's two-stage (heuristic/analytic processing) model of reasoning. }

One hundred participants completed a battery of standard judgment tasks, including multiple cue judgment and tasks based on the “heuristics and biases” and problem-solving literature. Participants also completed tests of fluid and crystallized intelligence, forward digit span memory, and multiple cue probability learning. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated a two-factor structure underlying performance on these tasks and tests. The two moderately correlated factors reflected a distinction between tasks requiring accurate judgments based on multiple cues (correspondence tasks) and those requiring coherent judgments (coherence tasks), in which probabilities are compared and combined. Measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence and forward digit span memory were correlated with both factors but were more associated with correspondence than with coherence.

We report on the outcomes of a study based on a heterogeneous set of seven cognitive biases — anchoring effect, belief bias, overconfidence bias, hindsight bias, base rate neglect, outcome bias and sunk cost effect. New scales for the assessment of these biases were administered to 243 undergraduate students along with measures of fluid (Gf) and crystallized (Gc) intelligence, a Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), Openness/Intellect (O/I) scale and Need for Cognition (NFC) scale. The expected experimental results were confirmed — i.e., each normatively irrelevant variable significantly influenced participants' responses. Also, with the exception of hindsight bias, all cognitive biases showed satisfactory reliability estimates (αs>.70). However, correlations among the cognitive bias measures were low (rs<.20). Although exploratory factor analysis produced two factors, their robustness was doubtful. Cognitive bias measures were also relatively independent (rs<.25) from the Gf, Gc, CRT, O/I and NFC and they define separate latent factors. This pattern of results suggests that a major part of the reliable variance of cognitive bias tasks is unique, and implies that a one-factor model of rational behavior is not plausible."
