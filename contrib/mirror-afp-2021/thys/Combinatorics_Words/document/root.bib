abstract = {The relationship between the length of a word and the maximum length of its unbordered factors is investigated in this article. Consider a finite word w of length n. We call a word bordered if it has a proper prefix, which is also a suffix of that word. Let μ(w) denote the maximum length of all unbordered factors of w, and let ∂(w) denote the period of w. Clearly, μ(w) ≤ ∂(w).We establish that μ(w) = ∂(w), if w has an unbordered prefix of length μ(w) and n ≥ 2μ(w) − 1. This bound is tight and solves the stronger version of an old conjecture by Duval [1983]. It follows from this result that, in general, n ≥ 3μ(w) − 3 implies μ(w) = ∂(w), which gives an improved bound for the question raised by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979.},
