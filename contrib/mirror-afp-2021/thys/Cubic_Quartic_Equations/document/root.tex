\title{Solving Cubic and Quartic Equations}
\author{Ren\'e Thiemann}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize Cardano's formula to solve a cubic equation 
\[
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0,
\]
as well as Ferrari's formula to solve a quartic equation \cite{AM}. 
We further turn both formulas into executable algorithms 
based on the algebraic number implementation in the AFP \cite{Algebraic_Numbers-AFP}. 
To this end we also slightly extended this library, namely by making
the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number executable, and by defining and
implementing $n$-th roots of complex numbers.
