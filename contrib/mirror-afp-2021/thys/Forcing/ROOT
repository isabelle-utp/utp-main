    Formalization of Forcing in Isabelle/ZF

    We formalize the theory of forcing in the set theory framework of
    Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable
    transitive model of ZFC, we construct a proper generic extension
    and show that the latter also satisfies ZFC.
