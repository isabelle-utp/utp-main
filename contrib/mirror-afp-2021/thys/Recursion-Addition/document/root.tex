\title{Recursion Theorem}
\author{Georgy Dunaev}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This document contains a proof of the recursion theorem.
  This is a mechanization of the proof of the recursion theorem from 
  the text \textit{Introduction to Set Theory}, by Karel Hrbacek 
  and Thomas Jech. This implementation may be used as the basis for 
  a model of Peano Arithmetic in ZF\@. While recursion and the natural
  numbers are already available in ZF, this clean development
  is much easier to follow.
