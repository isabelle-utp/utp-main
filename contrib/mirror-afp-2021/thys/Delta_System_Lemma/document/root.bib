     abstract = {We formalize the theory of forcing in the set theory framework of
Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable
transitive model of $\mathit{ZFC}$, we construct a proper generic extension and show
that the latter also satisfies $\mathit{ZFC}$. In doing so, we remodularized
Paulson's ZF-Constructibility library.},
