\title{From Abstract to Concrete G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems---Part II}
\author{Andrei Popescu \and Dmitriy Traytel}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} We validate an abstract formulation of G\"odel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem from a
\href{https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_Incompleteness.html}{separate AFP entry} by instantiating it to
the case of \emph{finite consistent extensions of the Hereditarily Finite (HF) Set theory}, i.e., consistent
FOL theories extending the HF Set theory with a finite set of axioms.

The instantiation draws heavily on infrastructure previously developed by Larry Paulson in his
\href{https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html}{direct formalisation of the concrete result}. It
strengthens Paulson’s formalization of G\"odel's Second from that entry by \emph{not} assuming soundness, and
in fact not relying on any notion of model or semantic interpretation. The strengthening was obtained by
first replacing some of Paulson’s semantic arguments with proofs within his HF calculus, and then plugging in
some of Paulson's (modified) lemmas to instantiate our soundness-free G\"odel's Second locale.
