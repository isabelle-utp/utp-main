\title{An Under-Approximate Relational Logic}
\author{Toby Murray}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Recently, authors have proposed \emph{under-approximate} logics for
  reasoning about programs~\cite{OHearn_19,deVries_Koutavas_11}.
  So far, all such logics have been confined to
  reasoning about individual program behaviours. Yet there exist many
  over-approximate \emph{relational} logics for reasoning about pairs of
  programs and relating their behaviours.

  We present the first under-approximate relational
  logic, for the simple imperative language IMP.
  We prove our logic
  is both sound and complete.
  Additionally,
  we show how reasoning in this logic
  can be decomposed into non-relational reasoning in an under-approximate
  Hoare logic, mirroring Beringer's result for over-approximate
  relational logics.
  We illustrate the application of our logic on some small
  examples in which we provably demonstrate the presence of insecurity.

  These proofs accompany a paper~\cite{murray2020underapproximate}
  that explains the results in more detail.
