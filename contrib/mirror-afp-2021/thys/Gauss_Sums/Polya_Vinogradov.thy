  The fully general variant will then simply be a corollary of this. First, we need some bounds on
  logarithms, exponentials, and the harmonic numbers:

  We are now ready to prove the `regular' Pólya--Vinogradov inequality.

  Apostol formulates it in the following way (Theorem 13.15, notation adapted):
  `If \<open>\<chi>\<close> is any nonprincipal character mod \<open>n\<close>, then for all \<open>x \<ge> 2\<close> we have
  $\sum_{m\leq x} \chi(m) = O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$.'

  The precondition \<open>x \<ge> 2\<close> here is completely unnecessary. The `Big-O' notation is somewhat
  problematic since it does not make explicit in what way the variables are quantified
  (in particular the \<open>x\<close> and the \<open>\<chi>\<close>). The statement of the theorem in this way (for a fixed
  character \<open>\<chi>\<close>) seems to suggest that \<open>n\<close> is fixed here, which would make the use of `Big-O'
  completely vacuous, since it is an asymptotic statement about \<open>n\<close>.

  We therefore decided to formulate the inequality in the following more explicit way,
  even giving an explicit constant factor:
\<close>
theorem (in dcharacter) polya_vinogradov_inequality:
  assumes nonprincipal: "\<chi> \<noteq> principal_dchar n"

proof -
  have "n div conductor > 0"
    using n conductor_dvd dvd_div_eq_0_iff[of conductor n] by auto
  have "norm (\<Sum>m=1..x. \<chi> m) < sqrt conductor * ln conductor * divisor_count (n div conductor)"
    using nonprincipal by (rule polya_vinogradov_inequality_explicit)
  also have "\<dots> \<le> sqrt conductor * ln conductor * (2 * sqrt (n div conductor))"
    using conductor_gr_0 \<open>n div conductor > 0\<close>
    by (intro mult_left_mono divisor_count_upper_bound') (auto simp: Suc_le_eq)
  also have "sqrt (n div conductor) = sqrt n / sqrt conductor"
    using conductor_dvd by (simp add: Real.real_of_nat_div real_sqrt_divide)
  also have "sqrt conductor * ln conductor * (2 * (sqrt n / sqrt conductor)) =
               2 * sqrt n * ln conductor"
