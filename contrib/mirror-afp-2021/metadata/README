Metadata format
---------------

We're using a simple INI-like format for configuration files.

-   File `metadata`

    Master storage for entry metadata. Format:

        [<short-name>]
        title = <title>
        author = <author1> [<<url1>>], <author2> ...
        date = <YYYY>-<MM>-<HH>
        topic = <topic>/<subtopic>/..., <topic2>/...
        abstract = <text>
        notify = <email1>, <email2>, ...

    Optional:

        contributors = <contributor1> [<<url1>>], <contributor2> ...
        license = LGPL

    Example:

        [Presburger-Automata]
        title = Formalizing the Logic-Automaton Connection
        author = Stefan Berghofer <http://www.in.tum.de/~berghofe>, Markus Reiter
        date = 2009-12-03
        topic = Computer Science/Automata, Logic
        abstract = This abstract has
          multiple lines ...
        notify = stefan.berghofer@example.org

    The section name (`<short-name>` in this terminology) must correspond to
    the folder name in `thys` directory. This short name is used as entry
    identifier during the whole process.

    Currently, only three levels of topics and subtopics are allowed, but
    you may specify as many topics as you wish. If multiple topics are
    specified, the entry will appear under each of them. Note that the
    short name must be the same as their name in the `thys` folder. The topic
    must also appear in the `topics` file (see below).

    For each author, you may provide an URI (either a web page or a mail
    address, the latter prepended with `mailto:`) in standard `<protocol:uri>`
    notation.

    The section header and the keys must not contain leading whitespaces. When
    continuing a value on a second line, this and the following lines must be
    preceded by a whitespace. The date is the submission date of the entry.

    If you've chosen multiple topics, you can separate them with commas.

    If you want to have some additional text fields like 'Note' or 'Change
    history' below the 'Abstract' column, you can use the `extra` facility:

        extra-<key> = <heading>: <text>

    where `<key>` denotes an identifier (most cases 0, 1, ...) unique for each
    entry. The particular `<key>` has no impact on output and is solely used for
    disambiguating multiple extra fields.

    Example:

        extra-0 = Warning: Untested...
        extra-1 = History: [2010-01-01] new year

    For entries with a license other than BSD, you can add a line

        license = LGPL

    Allowed values are BSD and LGPL.

    Finally, sometimes existing entries get significant contributions from
    other authors. These authors can be listed on a 'contributors' line.
    A separate change-history entry should indicated what these people
    have contributed

        contributors = Peter Lammich <http://cs.uni-muenster.de/sev/staff/lammich/>

        extra-history = ...

-   File `release-dates`

    To list the older releases, a mapping between date and Isabelle version
    is necessary.

    Format:

        <isabelle-version> = <release-date>

    Example:

        2003 = 2003-05-13
        2004 = 2004-04-19

    So, all tarballs between 2003-05-13 (inclusive) and 2004-04-19 (exclusive)
    will be treated as older release for 'Isabelle 2003'.

-   File `releases`

    Contains a list of all released tarballs. The youngest release is always
    ignored, so don't forget to add new releases when a new Isabelle version
    has been added to the `release-dates` file.

    Example:

        afp-AVL-Trees-2009-04-29.tar.gz
        afp-Abstract-Hoare-Logics-2007-11-27.tar.gz
        afp-Abstract-Hoare-Logics-2008-06-10.tar.gz

-   File `topics`

    Each topic and its subtopics must go into there. The format looks like that
    (where `_` denotes exactly one space character):

        first_level_topic
        __second_level_topic
        ____third_level_topic
        __another_second_level_topic

    Only three levels of indentation are supported currently.
