Web site & Site generator
-------------------------

The web site is generated by a set of Python scripts. As input, they take

-   the metadata of the entries (as specified in the `metadata` folder),
-   dependencies between entries (as generated by the `afp_dependencies` tool),
    and
-   static templates (in `metadata/templates`)

The output will be written to the `web` folder, which is supposed to be
committed into the repository. It can be inspected by opening any of the
contained HTML files in the browser.

The script can be invoked without any arguments:

    ./admin/sitegen

Changing static content, e.g. the submission guidelines, works by editing the
appropriate template file (see above) and re-running the `sitegen` script.
