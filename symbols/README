In this directory is an expanded Isabelle font and configuration files to
add the extra Z symbols. The font was extended by cherry picking additional
glyphs from Symbola.ttf, which is already part of the Isabelle font. In order 
to use the extended font, there are three things you need to do:

1) Update the Isabelle font. Download isabelle_fonts-20210302.tar.bz2 and 
unzip it to contrib/ in your Isabelle directory. Then, update etc/components
so that it points to this directory. This makes Isabelle aware of the 
additional glyphs.

2) Added new symbols to the table. Download symbols. It needs to either
extend the global symbol table in etc/, or else be added to your local one.
e.g. cat symbols >> $ISABELLE_HOME/etc/symbols

3) Add support for LaTeX generation. If you include zed.sty and isabellezed.sty
under ../document, then this will make document generation work.
